For example, I uploaded two dumps the first whit 2,55 € and the second with 1,85 € but they are in .mfd you can understand it more if can open  it with hexedit or with xxd. 

I have a problem when I search the amount in my dump, I do not find anything and when I told this to my computer guy, he said: " that could be a property code and you need to decode"
Sooooo I need your help thank you guys. (update you just need to give .mfd to GPT ahah) 
I have a lead with the first dump with the amount of 2,55 € and that do in hex FF and the dump we can find BB in the part who change between the two dumps, and you, what you do think about this ????
